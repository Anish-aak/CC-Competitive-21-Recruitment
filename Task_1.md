#Task #1

****

1. Create an account on [Codeforces](codeforces.com). This would be the platform on which contests would be held, so we advice you to get well acquainted with how to go about solving problems on the site. If you face any problems check out [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/184ovYEc0jZ4mx2UeBI8VtPD1KaKkPH-U1vFXVW1yxus/).
2. Fill out [this form], and join the [group] on Codeforces.
3. You have to learn and practice a few basic problem solving techniques to prepare for the contest. The following would be the basics that we suggest you to learn:
   1. **Data types** (not needed for Python), such as the range of ```int``` vs ```long long```
   2. The in-built **sorting** function in the language of your choice
   3. Performing **linear and binary search** for an element within an array
   4. Taking **strings** as inputs, and iterating over them
   5. Identifying the **time and space** complexity of a piece of code
4. Here are some resources to get you started:
   1. TBD
5. Here are some problems that you should try to solve before the first contest. You can ask us for help with these problems if you want, since they are just for your practice. Youâ€™ll have to submit solutions for all the problems by TBD in order to take part in the contest. We strongly encourage you to try all of them yourself as the contest will have similar problems. 
6. You have to submit a GitHub repository and upload your solution codes to all these problems. Mark the repository as private and share it with [email id].
